# Name: Sean Triece
# TU18,COSC1336, Lab 1, Fix print syntax errors
#
# A first program usually prints out a few words, like: Hello, world!
# It should be easy. But when learning a brand new language, even
# something "easy" can be difficult. Find and fix any errors below.
#
# This program contains many errors. Most are: SyntaxError
# Repair each output statement below so it outputs correctly.
# There should be a single space between words in your output.
# Each statement below, when repaired, displays some text.
# If the statement is written in non-Python, convert it into Python, using print()
#
# Statements can be repaired with the proper use of the print function
# and the proper use of string deliminators. Delimiters such as: ' or "
# A delimiter limits something - it/they indicate where something starts and stops.
# Delimiters often come in pairs, like: 'x' "x" (x) <x> {x} [x] \x\  /x/ .x. ,x, #x# |x|
#
# IF IT IS NOT BROKEN, DON'T FIX IT.
# Make fixes only if needed with the least amount of editing possible.
# When in doubt, look at what the string says. If it says:
# "Here are four double-quote marks:", then, after the text, it should display: """"
# Note the difference between double-quote " and single-quote '
# A correct solution will show multiple lines; Each new line starts with a number, in order 1..47
